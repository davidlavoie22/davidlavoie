        <h3> Why am I here?</h3>
        <h3> I am currently enrolled in a double major, for Marketing and New Media.</h3>
        <h3> The Home page for this website was designed with the idea of being simplistic.</h3>
        <h3> The entire goal of that page was to fit a design that is modern, and is marketable to creators of content.</h3>
        <h3> I do have a free ride right now due to scholarships and my job.</h3>
        <h3> I chose these majors because I love everything to do with computer software, and I want to apply it to marketing.</h3>

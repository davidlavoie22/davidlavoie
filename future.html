            <h1> Plans for the Future</h1>
            <h3> Currently I want to work for a company, or freelance and work for many at a time.</h3>
            <h3> I want to use what I have learned to market and pitch products, or be the one working on the ads.</h3>
            <h3> I also have a YouTube Channel on the side, and I hope to grow it of the course of my time in school.</h3>
            <h3> The last thing I have planned is bringing businesses to Maine, especially in the north.</h3>
            <h3> Our state is losing a lot of people to jobs in the south, but we have tons of land not being used.</h3>
            <h3> It would be awesome if we could bring people into the state, it's definatly something people should try.</h3>
